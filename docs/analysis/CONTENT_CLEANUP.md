## Remove Unnecessary Elements for Better Performance & UX

Based on analysis of common event website mistakes, here's what to **remove or avoid** adding to your E-Summit 2025 website.

---

## ‚úÖ **Your Current Website Status**

**Good News**: Your current multi-page website structure is **EXCELLENT** and doesn't have these problems!

This guide is preventive - to ensure you **don't add** unnecessary elements later.

---

## ‚ùå **Do NOT Add These Sections**

### 1. **Team/Organizing Committee Page**
**Why Remove**: 
- Attendees don't care who organizes
- Takes up space
- Unnecessary navigation item

**Keep Instead**:
- Small "About E-Cell" text in footer
- One line: "Organized by E-Cell, SIT"

**Example** ‚úÖ:
```html
<footer>
    <p>Organized by E-Cell, Saffrony Institute of Technology</p>
</footer>
```

---

### 2. **Gallery Section** (Before Event)
**Why Remove**:
- No photos yet (event hasn't happened)
- Just empty placeholders
- Can add after event for next year

**If You Have It**: Delete the gallery page entirely

**Future**: After Nov 7th, add post-event gallery with photos from 2025

---

### 3. **Blog/News/Articles Section**
**Why Remove**:
- Needs constant updates
- Nobody reads blogs on event sites
- Adds complexity

**Keep Instead**:
- Social media for updates
- WhatsApp group for announcements

**If You Have It**: Delete blog functionality

---

### 4. **Testimonials Section** (Before Event)
**Why Remove**:
- No testimonials yet
- Looks empty/fake

**Future**: After event, collect testimonials for E-Summit 2026

---

### 5. **Partners/Sponsors Carousel**
**Why Remove**:
- Distracting animations
- Slows down page
- Takes focus from registration

**Keep Instead**:
```html
<!-- Simple logos in footer -->
<footer>
    <div class="sponsors">
        <img src="sponsor1.png" alt="Sponsor" />
        <img src="sponsor2.png" alt="Sponsor" />
    </div>
</footer>
```

---

### 6. **Long History/About College Section**
**Why Remove**:
- Event website, not college website
- Takes up valuable space
- Makes navigation longer

**Keep Instead**:
- One line in footer: "SIT Mehsana, Gujarat"

---

### 7. **Social Media Feed Embed**
**Why Remove**:
- Slow loading
- Privacy concerns
- Layout breaks

**Keep Instead**:
```html
<!-- Just links to social media -->
<a href="https://instagram.com/ecell_sit">
    <i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
</a>
```

---

## üîç **Check Your Pages for These Issues**

### **1. Excessive Text Blocks**

**‚ùå Bad** (Too Much Text):
```html

This event aims to bring together aspiring entrepreneurs, students, and industry professionals to foster innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. The summit will feature workshops, speaker sessions, competitions, and networking opportunities. Over the course of two days, participants will engage in various activities designed to enhance their entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. The event will be held at the SIT campus in Mehsana, Gujarat, and is expected to attract over 500 participants from colleges across the state.</p>
```

**‚úÖ Good** (Concise):
```html
<p>Join 500+ students for E-Summit 2025 - Two days of workshops, competitions, and inspiring speaker sessions on entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>üöÄ Innovation workshops</li>
    <li>üé§ Industry speakers</li>
    <li>üèÜ Exciting competitions</li>
</ul>
```

**Action**: Replace paragraphs with bullet points

---

### **2. Multiple Competing CTAs**

```html
<button>Learn More</button>
<button>Explore</button>
<button>Discover</button>
<button>Register Now</button>
<button>Get Started</button>
```

**‚úÖ Good** (Clear Priority):
```html
<button class="primary">Register Now</button>
<button class="secondary">View Schedule</button>
```

**Action**: 
- ONE primary CTA: "Register Now"
- ONE secondary CTA: "Learn More" or "View Schedule"

- About College
- Team
- Gallery
- Events
- Schedule
- Competitions

```

<video autoplay loop muted>...</video>

<!-- Background video -->
<video class="bg-video" autoplay>...</video>

<!-- Auto-scrolling carousel -->
<div class="carousel" data-autoplay="true">...</div>
```

**‚úÖ Good**:
```html
<!-- Image with optional play button -->
<img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Event" />
<button onclick="playVideo()">‚ñ∂ Watch Video</button>
```

**Action**: Remove all `autoplay` attributes

---

### **5. Excessive Animations**

**‚ùå Bad** (Everything Animated):
```css
.everything {
    animation: bounce 1s infinite,
               spin 2s infinite,
               pulse 0.5s infinite,
               shake 3s infinite;
}
```

**‚úÖ Good** (Subtle):
```css
.hover-effect {
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.hover-effect:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);
}
```

**Action**: 
- Keep: Fade-in on load, hover effects, button animations
- Remove: Parallax, auto-scrolling, excessive effects

---

### **6. Heavy Background Images**

**‚ùå Bad**:
```html
<!-- 5MB background image -->
<div style="background-image: url('huge-photo.jpg')">
```

**‚úÖ Good**:
```html
<!-- Gradient background (poster theme) -->
<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1E0A33 0%, #3C1361 100%)">
```

**Action**: Replace photo backgrounds with gradients

---

### **7. Redundant Information**

**‚ùå Bad** (Repeated Info):
```html
<section id="about">
    <p>E-Summit 2025 on Nov 6-7</p>
</section>

<section id="schedule">
    <p>E-Summit 2025 on Nov 6-7</p>
</section>

<section id="register">
    <p>E-Summit 2025 on Nov 6-7</p>
</section>
```

**‚úÖ Good** (Say It Once):
```html
<section id="hero">
    <h1>E-Summit 2025</h1>
    <p>Nov 6-7, 2025 | SIT Mehsana</p>
</section>

<!-- Other sections just focus on their specific content -->
```
